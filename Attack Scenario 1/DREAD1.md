# DREAD Threat Model

This Mermaid diagram illustrates the DREAD model applied to an AI-generated external phishing email utilising admin credentials attack on the Medway health application. Here's a breakdown of the diagram:

The DREAD model components are shown: Damage Potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability.
Each component is linked to the AI-generated phishing email attack.

Each DREAD component is assigned a score based on the severity of the attack:

Damage Potential: High (9) due to potential access to sensitive patient data

Reproducibility: High (8) as AI can consistently generate convincing phishing emails

Exploitability: Medium (6) as it requires some user interaction

Affected Users: High (9) as it targets admin credentials, potentially affecting all users

Discoverability: Medium (5) as sophisticated AI-generated emails may be harder to detect

The Risk Calculation subgraph shows the final risk score, calculated as the average of the five DREAD components.

The Attack Details subgraph provides additional information about the nature of the AI-generated phishing attack.
Different colours are used to distinguish between the DREAD components, the attack, the scores, the final calculation, and the attack details.

This diagram provides a clear visual representation of how the DREAD model is applied to assess the risk of an AI-generated external phishing email utilisng admin credentials attack on the Medway health application.
