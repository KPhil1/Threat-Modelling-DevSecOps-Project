# PASTA Threat Model


This Mermaid diagram illustrates the PASTA model applied to an AI-generated external phishing email utilising admin credentials attack on the Medway health application. 

The diagram shows the flow from objectives to technical scope, application decomposition, threats, vulnerabilities, attack modelling, and finally to risk and impact analysis. Different colours are used to distinguish between the PASTA model components, making it easier to visualise the threat analysis process for this specific AI-powered phishing attack scenario.
