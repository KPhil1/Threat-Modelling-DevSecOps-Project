# STRIDE Threat Model


This Mermaid diagram illustrates the STRIDE threat model analysis for an AI-generated external phishing email utilising admin credentials to attack the Medway health application. Here's a breakdown of the diagram:

The central node represents the AI-generated phishing attack.

The STRIDE model components are shown: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

Each STRIDE component is linked to specific threats relevant to the AI-generated phishing attack:

Spoofing: Impersonation of Admin, Fake Email Domain

Tampering: Altered Email Content, Manipulated Links

Repudiation: Untraceable Attack Origin, Deleted Attack Logs

Information Disclosure: Credential Theft, Patient Data Exposure

Denial of Service: Email System Overload, Account Lockouts

Elevation of Privilege: Unauthorised Admin Access, Privilege Escalation

The Medway Health Application components (Email System, Authentication Module, Patient Database) are shown, with arrows indicating how the specific threats relate to each component.

Different colours are used to distinguish between the attack, STRIDE components, specific threats, and application components.

This diagram provides a clear visual representation of how the STRIDE model can be applied to analyse the threats posed by an AI-generated phishing attack targeting the Medway health application.
