# Attack 1 Summary: DDoS Attack on Medway Health App

## Stages of the Attack

### Origins
The attack is initiated by a threat actor leveraging a long history of cyber attack techniques. The attacker identifies the Medway Health 360 application as a target due to its sensitive health data and public-facing nature.

### Reconnaissance
Attackers identify the Medway health app as a target. They gather information about the app's infrastructure, IP addresses, and potential vulnerabilities. The attackers determine the app's critical services and peak usage times.

### Weaponisation
The attacker prepares a botnet or rents DDoS-for-hire services. They select attack vectors (e.g., UDP floods, SYN floods, HTTP floods) and configure attack tools and malware for maximum impact.

### Delivery
No traditional malware delivery is required for most DDoS attacks. Instead, attackers prepare their botnet or DDoS infrastructure for the assault on the Medway health app. 

### Exploitation
The attacker launches the DDoS attack against the Medway health app. They overwhelm the app's servers with a flood of traffic from multiple sources. 
The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Medway Health 360 application's infrastructure or network protocols.

### Installation
Not typically applicable in a DDoS attack scenario.  However, if the attack includes malware components, infected devices may become part of the botnet. 

### Command and Control
The attacker coordinates the botnet or DDoS infrastructure. They adjust attack parameters in real-time based on the target's response, potentially switching attack vectors if initial attempts are mitigated. 

### Actions on Objectives
The attacker can disrupt the Medway health app's services. Additionally, the attacker may 
prevent legitimate users from accessing critical healthcare information and potentially cause financial losses and reputational damage to the healthcare provider.
