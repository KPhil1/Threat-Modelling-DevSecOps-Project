# DIAMOND Threat Model

This Mermaid diagram illustrates the Diamond Model applied to a DDoS attack on the Medway health application. 

Here's a breakdown of the diagram:

The central node represents the DDoS attack on the Medway health application.

The Diamond Model components are shown: Adversary, Capability, Infrastructure, and Victim.

Each component is linked to specific elements relevant to the DDoS attack:

Adversary: Cybercriminal Group, Hacktivist Organisation

Capability: Botnet Control, Traffic Amplification Techniques, DDoS-for-Hire Services

Infrastructure: Compromised IoT Devices, Rented Server Farms, Reflection/Amplification Servers

Victim: Medway Health Application, Web Servers, Network Infrastructure

Meta-Features are included to provide additional context:

Timestamp: Current Date

Phase: Service Disruption

Result: Application Unavailability

Direction: Inbound

Methodology: Volumetric DDoS

Different colours are used to distinguish between the Diamond Model components, the attack, the specific elements, and the meta-features.

This diagram provides a clear visual representation of how the Diamond Model can be applied to analyse the threats posed by a DDoS attack targeting the Medway health application.
