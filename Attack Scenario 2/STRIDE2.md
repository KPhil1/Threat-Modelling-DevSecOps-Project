# STRIDE Threat Model


This Mermaid diagram illustrates the STRIDE model applied to a DDoS attack on the Medway health application. Here's a breakdown of the diagram:

The central node represents the DDoS attack on the Medway health application.

The STRIDE model components are shown: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

Each STRIDE component is linked to specific threats relevant to the DDoS attack:

Spoofing: IP Address Spoofing, DNS Spoofing

Tampering: Packet Manipulation, Protocol Exploitation

Repudiation: Botnet Use, Traffic Obfuscation

Information Disclosure: Traffic Analysis, Data Leakage During Attack

Denial of Service: Network Flooding, Resource Exhaustion

Elevation of Privilege: Exploiting Vulnerabilities, Compromising Network Devices

The Medway Health Application components (Web Servers, Network Infrastructure, Patient Database) are shown, with arrows indicating how the specific threats relate to each component.

Different colours are used to distinguish between the attack, STRIDE components, specific threats, and application components.

This diagram provides a clear visual representation of how the STRIDE model can be applied to analyse the threats posed by a DDoS attack targeting the Medway health application, focusing on the specific aspects of the STRIDE framework in the context of DDoS attacks.
