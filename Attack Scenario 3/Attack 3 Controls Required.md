# Controls Required:



- Conduct regular security testing, frequent vulnerability scans and penetration tests, and perform code reviews focused on identifying SQL injection vulnerabilities.

- Patch management to ensure software is up-to-date and regularly update database systems, web servers, and application frameworks.

- Train developers on secure coding techniques to prevent SQL injection and follow coding best practices like avoiding string concatenation in queries.

- Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter and monitor HTTP traffic and configure WAF rules to detect and block SQL injection attempts.  

- Validate all user inputs for expected data types, lengths, and formats, use whitelisting to allow only approved characters and patterns, and sanitise inputs by removing or escaping potentially malicious characters.

- Use parameterised queries (prepared statements) instead of dynamic SQL. This separates SQL code from user inputs, preventing injection.

- Utilise stored procedures to isolate database queries and ensure stored procedures don't generate dynamic SQL.

- Use least privilege principle to restrict database user privileges to the minimum required and implement role-based access control (RBAC)

- Properly escape special characters in user inputs before using in queries.

- For error handling, implement custom error pages to avoid exposing database details and turn off verbose database errors in production.

- Implement database activity monitoring to detect suspicious queries and use anomaly detection systems to identify unusual data access patterns.
