# PASTA Threat Modelling

This Mermaid diagram illustrates the PASTA model for threat modelling a SQL injection attack on the Medway health application. It follows the seven steps of the PASTA methodology:

1/ Define Objectives: Protect patient data and system integrity.

2/ Define Technical Scope: Web Application, Database Server, and Network Infrastructure.

3/ Decompose Application: User Interface, Authentication Module, Data Access Layer, and Patient Records Database.

4/ Analyse Threats: SQL Injection, Data Exfiltration, and Unauthorised Access.

5/ Vulnerabilities and Weaknesses: Lack of Input Sanitisation, Weak Input Validation, and Overprivileged Database User.

6/ Attack Modelling: Craft malicious SQL query, Bypass authentication, and Extract sensitive data.

7/ Risk and Impact Analysis: Data breach, Regulatory non-compliance, and Reputational damage.

The diagram shows the flow from objectives to technical scope analysis. This structured approach helps in systematically identifying and addressing potential security issues related to SQL injection in the Medway health application
